<b>The Unicorn</b>
is the protagonist of the story.
<br>
She leaves the safety of her forest upon learning that she is the last unicorn in the world, with information about
the Red Bull as her only clue.
When she first encounters the Red Bull, Schmendrick manages to inadvertently change the Unicorn into a human female
to confuse the Red Bull and force its withdrawal.
Schmendrick calls her "Lady Amalthea" so as not to arouse King Haggard's suspicions.
Beagle notes that he took the name "Amalthea" from a Greek deity with the same name.
<br>
<br>
<b>The Butterfly</b>
is an eccentric character who happens upon the Unicorn at the beginning of the story.
<br>
While speaking in riddles and songs, he manages to give the Unicorn some vital information about the other unicorns'
whereabouts.
Beagle stated that the butterfly's dialogue is drawn from things that amused him and his childhood friend,
Phil Sigunick, during a trip to Berkshire Hills where Beagle began writing the novel.
<br>
<br>
<b>Mommy Fortuna</b>
is a wicked old witch, who uses her dark magic to run a sideshow carnival for profit.
<br>
The carnival features what appear to be mythical creatures, but are actually just normal animals that have been
enchanted, with the exception of the harpy, Celaeno.
According to Beagle, the name "Fortuna" was taken from the Roman goddess of fortune, and German mythical
hero Fortunatus.
<br>
<br>
<b>Schmendrick</b>
is a bumbling magician who travels with Mommy Fortuna's traveling carnival out of pure necessity.
<br>
Reduced to entertaining the sightseers who come to the carnival, Schmendrick wants nothing more than to become a true,
powerful magician who does not rely on card tricks and cheap illusions. He sees Mommy Fortuna as an opportunity to
gain experience, but when he sees the captured Unicorn for what she is, he decides to free her and join her on her
quest. Schmendrick was a character Beagle had initially made up for his children's bedtime stories, and was
called "the world's worst magician". The name "Schmendrick the Magician" is a parody of the
character "Mandrake the Magician", and is also drawn from a Yiddish word that Beagle defines as "somebody out
of his depth, the boy sent to do a man's job, someone who has expanded to the limits of his incapacity."
<br>
<br>
<b>Captain Cully</b>
is the leader of a second-rate band of outlaws in direct opposition to King Haggard.
<br>
Although he attempts to be dashing and hospitable, Cully falls victim to his own jealousy of famous mythical outlaws
such as Robin Hood, an illusion of whom Schmendrick inadvertently conjures. According to Beagle, Captain Cully's
name is drawn from an old English slang word for "buddy".
<br>
<br>
<b>Molly Grue</b>
is Captain Cully's common-law wife.
<br>
As a young woman she had eloped with him, naively attracted to the romance of loving a woodland fugitive and
sharing his life. Unfortunately, this turned into years of serving Cully's ragged vagrants as their camp cook.
She seeks a different reality from the one fate decided for her, and when she discovers Schmendrick leaving with
the unicorn, she decides to follow them and do whatever she can to help the unicorn in her quest.
Molly Grue's name is drawn from a French word meaning "crane". While never initially making the connection,
Beagle notes that it is possible that the name was also inspired by Molly Epstein,
his "favorite writing teacher in high school".
<br>
<br>
<b>The Red Bull</b>
is a magical creature, blind but powerful, which is sensitive to the presence of any unicorn and tries to
intimidate it into submission, thence driving it into the sea.
<br>
Neither the Red Bull's affiliation with King Haggard nor its pattern of behaviour is explained, but these both end
when finally the Last Unicorn stands up to it.
<br>
<br>
<b>King Haggard</b>
is a miserable and cruel King who cares for no one, not even his adopted son Prince Lír.
<br>
His loneliness and misery is only alleviated by the sight of unicorns, and this drove him to capture all of them
for his own pleasure. He commands the powerful Red Bull, who has driven all the unicorns into the sea underneath of
his castle by his own decree. The name "Haggard" is based on the actual word. Beagle stated that "on the one hand,
it is a particular look, but on the other it's also a falconer's term. It's what you call an undomesticated hawk,
a bird that knows the rudiments but is not reliable. If you fly a haggard, you might never see it again, it might go
back to the wild." He also went on to say that he has "never really been able to see [Haggard] as a villain",
explaining that he saw much of his own character in Haggard to the point that he "felt sorry for him".
<br>
<br>
<b>Prince Lír</b>
is a skilled hero who was adopted by King Haggard, who found him in the town of Hagsgate.
<br>
Despite living with Haggard, Prince Lír is the opposite of his adopted father, living his life with valor, honor,
and compassion for others. He falls in love with Lady Amalthea, not realizing what she is until the very end.
For all of her arrogance towards humankind, the Unicorn falls in love with Lír. Beagle stated that he "knew that the
prince's name had to be one syllable", and that he made a long list of one-syllable names to choose from.
He chose "Lír" because he liked the sound of it, but later on noted that he had borrowed the name of a Celtic sea god,
Llyr, and that the fact that Lír became "King Lír" after succeeding his adoptive father "echoed Shakespeare".
